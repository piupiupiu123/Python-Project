Project Description

In this project, you'll apply your Python skills to answer a real-world question. You'll aim to discover if Netflix's movies are getting shorter over time using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

You'll also gain experience in an essential data science skill â€” exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. Press play to begin!
